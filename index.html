		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p> 
			I am an honest, Responsible, Loyal, Reliable, Well-behaved and dedicated individual with good
			communication skills and coming from a disadvantaged enviroment has made me a hard-working individual
			striving and excelling in creativity, innovation, accepting responsibility, team work and decision
			making. I take pride in going an extra mile to make things come together and to achieve the main goal.
			I am a person who is willing to listen and learn. My main objective is to work in a good industry so 
			that I can explore what I have learnt throughout my work experience and be great asset on what I will
			be doing.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a data analyst working in SEO, my primary responsibility is to collect, analyze and interpret data related to website traffic and
			search engine rankings. I use tools such as Google Analytics, Google Search Console, SEMRush, Ahrefs and other SEO software to
			collect data and create reports that provide insights to clients or stakeholders. One of the key tools I use to create these reports is
			Google Data Studio. This platform allows me to easily create custom dashboards and visualizations that present data in a way that
			is easy to understand and actionable.
